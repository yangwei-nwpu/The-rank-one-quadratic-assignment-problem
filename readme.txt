1. The format of the test file is as follows:

First row: the size of test case and the objective value

The objective value is useless in milp that you can ignore it. But it is useful in the BLS as a termination condition. 
You can set the value you want or as small as possible to find a better solution. 

Then, follewed by the elements of matrix which correspond to the matrix A, B and C.

2. The format of the solution file is as follows:

First row: the best value found by algorithm.

Third row: The best solution found by algorithm.
